"Your Assignment:
Find the value of inverse of a matrix, determinant of a matrix by using the following values:"

```{r comment = NA}
library(MASS)

x <- matrix(c(-2,2,-3,-1,1,3,2,0,-1),3,3)
A=matrix(1:100, nrow=10) 
B=matrix(1:10000, nrow=100)
det(A)
det(B)
A[1:5,1:5]
B[1:5,1:5]


invA = ginv(A)
invB = ginv(B)

invA[1:5,1:5]
invB[1:5,1:5]
```

The determinant in both of these matrices is 0, therefore the inverses should be undefined, however the function 'ginv' still provided inverses andI am unsure how.
